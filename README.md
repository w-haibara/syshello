# syshello
A script for development of Linux system call.
This repo was developed  referencing this cite: https://postd.cc/kernel-dev-ep3/.

# Enviroment
This repo was developed on the Archlinux (Linux kernel 5.3.5) on VirtualBox.
I download the OS from this cite: https://www.osboxes.org/arch-linux/.

# Usage
First, clone this repo, change the access permissions of setup.sh, and download Linux kernel source code.
```
$ git clone github.com/w-haibara/syshâ€¦
$ cd syshello
$ sudo su
# chmod 755 setup.sh
# ./setup.sh init
```
Write a function of your call to mycall.c. 
When kernel is builded, mycall.c is expanded in last of kernel/sys.c.

Build kernel with your system call by executing ./setup.sh deploy
```
# ./setup.sh deploy
# reboot
```
If succesfully finished build, you can check the message from your system call. 
```
$ sudo su
# cd ./syshello
# gcc mycallTest.c
# ./a.out
# dmesg | grep hello
```
